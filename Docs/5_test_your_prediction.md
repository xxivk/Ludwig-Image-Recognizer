## Saving Predicted Images and Results

Congratulations on successfully training and using your image recognition model! Now, let's take a look at the results. We need the following files to proceed:

1. **Prediction CSV**: This CSV file contains the predictions made by the model on the test dataset.
2. **Test Dataset CSV**: The CSV file of the test dataset that we created earlier in step 4.

Now, follow these steps to save the predicted images and visualize the results:

1. Go to the file `Utilities/save_predicted_images.py`.

2. Make the following modifications:

   - On line 7, load the test CSV file by replacing `'test.csv'` with the path to your test dataset CSV file. For example:
     ```python
     test_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/test.csv')
     ```

   - On line 8, load the prediction CSV file by replacing `'add_Prediction_CSV_file'` with the path to the Prediction CSV file generated during the prediction step. The code should look like this:
     ```python
     predictions_df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/prediction.csv', header=None, names=['predicted_label'])
     ```

   - On line 11, set the `predicted_images_dir` to the desired path where you want to store the predicted images. For example:
     ```python
     predicted_images_dir = 'path/to/your/predicted_images'
     ```

3. Save the file after making the changes.

4. Now, run the Python script `save_predicted_images.py`.

Upon running the script, you will notice a new folder called `predicted_images` containing the predicted images with labels generated by your model. You've successfully completed the process!

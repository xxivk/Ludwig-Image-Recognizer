## Saving Predicted Images and Results

Congratulations on successfully training and using your image recognition model! Now, let's take a look at the results. We need the following files to proceed:

1. **Prediction CSV**: This CSV file contains the predictions made by the model on the test dataset.
2. **Test Dataset CSV**: The CSV file of the test dataset that we created earlier in step 4.

Now, follow these steps to save the predicted images and visualize the results:

1. Go to the file `utilities.py`.

2. Make the following modifications:

   - On line 86, load the test CSV file by replacing `'test.csv'` with the path to your test dataset CSV file. For example:
     ```python
          test_csv_path = 'test.csv'
     ```

   - On line 87, load the prediction CSV file by replacing `'predictions_csv_path'` with the path to the Prediction CSV file generated during the prediction step. The code should look like this:
     ```python
     predictions_csv_path = 'results\prediction\label_predictions.csv'
     ```

   - On line 91, set the `predicted_images_dir` to the desired path where you want to store the predicted images. For example:
     ```python
     predicted_images_dir = 'desired_directory_path'
     ```

3. Save the file after making the changes.

4. Now, run the Python script `save_predicted_images`.

Upon running the script, you will notice a new folder called `predicted_images` containing the predicted images with labels generated by your model. You've successfully completed the process!

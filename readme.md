Ludwig Image Recognizer is a deep learning project for character recognition in images. The main goal of this project is to recognize characters from the popular TV show "The Simpsons." The model is trained on a large dataset of Simpson character images, allowing it to accurately identify various characters from the show.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install ludwig
   ```

## Usage

Follow these steps in the [Docs](https://github.com/xxivk/Ludwig-Image-Recognizer/tree/master/Docs) folder to use Ludwig Image Recognizer.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training Ludwig Image Recognizer consists of thousands of images of Simpsons characters. The dataset was taken from Kaggle: [The Simpsons Characters Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset?resource=download). Each character's image is labeled with the corresponding character name. The model has been trained extensively on this dataset to achieve high accuracy in character recognition.

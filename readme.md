Ludwig Image Recognizer is a deep learning project for character recognition in images. The main goal of this project is to recognize characters from the popular TV show "The Simpsons." The model is trained on a large dataset of Simpson character images, allowing it to accurately identify various characters from the show.

## Features

- State-of-the-art deep learning model for character recognition.
- Supports recognition of a wide range of Simpsons characters.
- Easy-to-use API for predicting character labels from new images.
- Pre-trained model checkpoint for quick deployment.

## Installation

To use Ludwig Image Recognizer, follow these simple installation steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use Ludwig Image Recognizer:

1. Prepare your test images in a separate folder.
2. Use the provided pre-trained model checkpoint or train your own using the training script.
3. Run the prediction script to predict character labels for your test images.

Example usage:
```
python predict.py --model_checkpoint model/checkpoint.pth --test_images_folder test_images
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training Ludwig Image Recognizer consists of thousands of images of Simpsons characters. Each character's image is labeled with the corresponding character name. The model has been trained extensively on this dataset to achieve high accuracy in character recognition.
